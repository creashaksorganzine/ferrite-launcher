//! Best-effort Discord Rich Presence over the local Discord IPC transport.
//!
//! [`DiscordPresence`] owns one connected IPC client. Constructing it connects and
//! publishes an initial activity; subsequent calls replace or clear that activity.
//! Dropping the value clears presence and closes the connection, which makes storing
//! it in an `Option` a convenient way to tie the IPC lifecycle to an enable setting.
//!
//! Discord integration is non-essential launcher functionality, so failures are
//! reported to standard error rather than propagated after construction. No Discord
//! user token is requested or stored; the numeric ID passed to the client identifies
//! the Discord application whose Rich Presence assets are referenced.
